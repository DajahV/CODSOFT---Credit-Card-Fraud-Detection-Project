# This is a Data Science Internship I participate in with CODSOFT

In this internship project I work on a develop a model that classify weither a credit card transaction is fraudulent or legitimate 

<a href> Click here to see my YouTube video for a stepwise approach I took to solve this problem

I build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions. I preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.
